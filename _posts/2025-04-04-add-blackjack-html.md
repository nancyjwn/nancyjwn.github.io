## üìñ Project Overview
This project is a web-based Blackjack game designed to provide an interactive card-playing experience through a browser. Blackjack is a popular card game where players compete against the dealer to get a card value as close as possible to 21 without exceeding it.  

### Key Features:
- Players start with an initial balance (e.g., $5000).  
- Players place bets before starting the game.  
- Players can choose to **Hit** (draw a card) or **Stand** (stop drawing cards).  
- The dealer plays according to standard rules (must draw cards until reaching a minimum value of 17).  
- The winner is determined based on the card values of both the player and the dealer.  

## Project Objectives
The objective of this project is to create a web-based Blackjack simulation as a means of learning programming logic, developing an interactive user interface, and providing simple entertainment. This project also helps in practicing the use of **HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript** to build a web application.

## Main Features
Here are the key features included in this project:  
#### 1. **User Interface (UI):**  
- Responsive design using **Tailwind CSS**.  
- Players start with an initial balance of **$5000**.  
- Input field to enter the bet amount (minimum **$100**).  
- Visualization of player and dealer cards using card images.  

#### 2. **Game Logic:**  
- Players can choose **Hit** to draw a card or **Stand** to stop drawing cards.  
- The dealer automatically draws cards until reaching a minimum value of **17**.  
- Winner determination based on the card values of the player and the dealer:  
  - The **player wins** if their card value is higher than the dealer‚Äôs without exceeding **21**.  
  - The **dealer wins** if their card value is higher than the player‚Äôs or if the player **busts** (exceeds **21**).  
  - A **push (tie)** occurs if both the player and dealer have the same card value.  

#### 3. **Betting Features:**  
- Players can place bets before starting the game.  
- The player's balance is updated based on the game result:  
  - **Winning** increases the balance based on the bet amount.  
  - **Losing** decreases the balance based on the bet amount.  
  - If the balance runs out, the game displays a **Game Over** message.  

#### 4. üÉè **Card Images:**  
- Card images are retrieved from the **images** folder to visually display the player‚Äôs and dealer‚Äôs cards.  

#### 5. **Additional Features:**  
- Players can continue playing after completing a round.  
- Players can **restart** the game with the initial balance if their balance runs out.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
This project is built using the following technologies:  
1. **HTML**: For structuring the web page.  
2. **CSS (Tailwind CSS)**: For styling and responsive design.  
3. **JavaScript**: For game logic, user interaction, and DOM manipulation.  
4. **Card Images**: Card image files are stored in the **images** folder and used for visual representation of the cards.

- The player can choose **Hit** to draw an additional card.  
- The player can choose **Stand** to stop drawing cards.  

#### 4. **Dealer‚Äôs Turn:**  
- The dealer automatically draws cards until reaching a minimum value of **17**.  

#### 5. **Determining the Winner:**  
- The player‚Äôs and dealer‚Äôs card values are compared to determine the winner.  
- **If the player wins**, their balance increases based on the bet amount.
