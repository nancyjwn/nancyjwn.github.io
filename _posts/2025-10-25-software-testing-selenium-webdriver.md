## What is Selenium?

- **Selenium** is an open-source framework for **browser automation**.
- It is widely used to **test web applications** with different programming languages.
- Supports multiple browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari.

### Advantages of Selenium

Main reasons for using Selenium include:

- **Open-source and free**.
- **Multi-platform** support (Windows, macOS, Linux).
- Supports multiple programming languages (*Python, Java, C#, JavaScript*).
- Can **integrate with other testing frameworks** such as Pytest, JUnit, and TestNG.
- Large community support and comprehensive documentation.

## What is Selenium WebDriver?

- **WebDriver** is the **core component** of Selenium.
- Acts as a **bridge between test code and the browser**.
- Its role is to **control the browser** (e.g., clicks, text input, navigation, and validation).

### Selenium WebDriver Workflow

1. **Test Scripts** (written in Java, Python, PHP, C#, Perl, or Ruby).
2. The script is sent to **WebDriver**.
3. WebDriver controls the **browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc.) to execute testing commands.

## Basic Automation Process with Python

The practical steps of web automation include:

- Installing Selenium with Python.
- Launching a browser using Selenium.
- Interacting with HTML elements (click, text input, etc.).

## Example Test Scenarios and Test Cases

Example scenarios demonstrated in the live coding session (likely using SauceDemo as the target application):

### Test Scenarios

- **TS-001**: Successful login on the SauceDemo page.
- **TS-002**: Failed login with incorrect credentials.
- **TS-003**: Adding a product to the cart.

### Test Cases

| ID | Description | Steps | Expected Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **TC-001** | Successful login | Enter `standard_user` & `secret_sauce`. Click Login. | User is redirected to the *inventory* page. |
| **TC-002** | Failed login | Enter invalid credentials. Click Login. | Error message is displayed. |
| **TC-003** | Add product to cart | Successful login â†’ Click "Add to cart". | Cart count increases by 1. |
